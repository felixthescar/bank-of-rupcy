## DotNet Frontend

Please disregard the name of the project, as DotNet is not a programming language I am accustomed to, especially using RazorPages.

The primary reason this application lacks a Dockerfile is due to the inherent challenges associated with setting up a DotNet Project, particularly for beginners and especially in Linux environments.

This is primarily a front-end application, operating as a WebProject utilizing RazorPages. It encompasses model classes, controllers, and cshtml pages. The core functionality revolves around executing API calls.
