# Bank Of Rupcy - Complete Edition

This application has been developed this application with the intention of showcasing it during my university presentation as part of the Distributed Services Oriented Architectures course.

This project integrates various technologies, encompassing (but not limited to):
- Docker
- MySQL/MariaDB Server
- DotNet Frontend using Razorpages
- Java Microservices
- Maven and SpringBoot

The Spring Backend, in conjunction with the MySQL Server, has been containerized utilizing Docker. The backend employs a customized image, accessible as a Dockerfile located within the Spring-Backend directory in this repository.

The decision to refrain from containerizing the frontend into a custom Docker image is attributed to constraints in time and effort experienced during the final stages of development.
